Just a small collection of projects I have written, perhaps with some notes on where the libraries came from:

BBSBControllerImpersonator:

 * Nanode RF BBSB online controller simulator
 * This allows you to use tools that can talk to thte Bye bye standbye contoller, without having to buy the online controller.
 * Note this code is designed to work with a nanode RF, with a seperate 433 transmitter (not the transmitter on-board the device).
 * This code is based around the EtherCard TFTP sample (https://github.com/thiseldo/EtherCardExamples/blob/master/EtherCard_TFTPServer/EtherCard_TFTPServer.ino)
 * and the following home easy controller software: http://arduino.cc/playground/Code/HomeEasy?action=sourceblock&num=3
 * My nanode is running the default bootloader. The TX pin of the 433 transmitter should be plugged into pin A0.
 * Please let me know if you find this code useful (first published open source code!)

You will require the following libraries: (all taken on the 20/12/2011)
*EtherCard:= https://github.com/jcw/ethercard 
*NanodeMac:= https://github.com/thiseldo/NanodeMAC 

The project was written using Arduino 1.0.
